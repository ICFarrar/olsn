## Project Overview

Kaeden OLSN is the inspiration behind Project OLSN, and this project aims to create a specialized EMG hand that will greatly improve Kaeden's quality of life. Electromyography (EMG) technology allows for the measurement of electrical activity in the muscles, which can be harnessed to control prosthetic limbs or other assistive devices. This EMG hand will be tailored to Kaeden's unique needs, enabling them to regain dexterity and independence.

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
- Design and build a functional EMG hand that can be controlled by the user's muscle signals.
- Customize the hand to match Kaeden's physical and functional requirements.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for easy control and calibration.
- Continuously improve and refine the design and functionality based on feedback and advancements in technology.

## Key Features

- **EMG Control**: The EMG hand allows Kaeden to control its movements and grip through muscle signals, providing a natural and intuitive user experience.

- **Customization**: The hand is personalized to Kaeden's specific needs, ensuring a comfortable fit and optimal functionality.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The interface is designed to be easy to use and configure, making it accessible for Kaeden and their caregivers.

- **Continuous Improvement**: We are committed to ongoing development, incorporating feedback and advancements in EMG technology to enhance the hand's performance and capabilities.
